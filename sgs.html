			<h3>Keep in mind:</h3>
			<h4><span class="yellowtext">1. We don't grade dirty shoes (accurately).</span></h4>
			Nobody wants to receive a pair of dirty shoes, ever. We know cleaning shoes is a pain and is time consuming, but we need you to put your best foot forward. Any dirt we see - we're just going to assume it's stained and grade it accordingly.
			<h4><span class="yellowtext">2.We don't grade boxes.</span></h4>
			We know they're neat and they look cool and add another dimension to your collection, but they're just too difficult to grade.<br><small>*If we receive a box, we won't grade them and will only send them back with a $10 fee. Seriously.*</small>
			<h4><span class="yellowtext">3. We don't grade counterfeit shoes.</span></h4> We know the market for fakes is huge, but it is something we fundamentally disagree with and simply will not support. If we notice you've submitted too many fake requests - you will be banned from our services.
