    <p><small>International users, please contact us FIRST before ordering.</small></p>
    <p><small>Each pair of shoes is methodically examined and reviewed by each of our graders to ensure expert instinctive impressions are in agreement. This intuitive sense has been developed after many years of examining thousands of pairs of shoes. Our experts are extremely familiar with the many different variation, structure and materials used for mass shoe production since the early 80's. The graders then collaborate and employ a scoring system for the final determination of a final grade. Certified items are then given an alpha-numeric registration number and a tamper-evident TSS label is applied to either the hang tag or the container. Shoes that fail our strict examintion standards for certification are returned with an explanation of the inconsistencies.</small></p>
    <p><small> The Sneaker Savant will provide collectors with the finest, most thorough, consistent and accurate grading efforts available in the industry. We guarantee our turn around time - the time in which the shoes are in the possession of The Sneaker Savant (time in transit, weekends and holidays excluded) and begin the day after your order is received. Failure to meet our deadlines will result in a customer refund. The Sneaker Savant shall not be deemed to be in default of or to have breached any provision of this guarantee as a result of any delay, failure in performance or interruption of the Services, resulting directly or indirectly from acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, civil disturbance, war, fire, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, transportation contingencies, shortages of facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials, or laws, regulations, acts or order of any government agency or official thereof, other catastrophes, delays of subcontractors or suppliers arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of either the Contractor or the subcontractors or suppliers, or any other circumstances beyond Provider's reasonable control. In the event of any such delay or failure, the parties shall defer performance of the Services to a date and time mutually agreeable.</small></p>

            <h4>International users, please contact us FIRST before ordering.</h4>
            <h4>1. We receive your shoes.</h4>
            <p>Preferably clean (dirty shoes get lower grades). No boxes. TSS’s receiving department opens newly arrived packages each morning and immediately verifies that the number of shoes in each package matches the number shown on the invoice. Once this is done, a more detailed comparison is made to ensure that their invoice descriptions correspond to the actual shoes. This information is traceable at all stages of the grading process by the invoice number. Before any grading is performed, each pair is examined by a restoration detection professional. If any form of restoration work is detected, this information is noted so that it will be available to the grading team.</p>
            <h4>2. We inspect and grade your shoes.</h4>
            <p>Using our 27-point inspection process, any peculiarities or flaws that may affect a shoe’s grade are tracked. Some examples of this would be “significant toe box creasing,” “scuffs on leather,” “a ¼” inch scratch,” and so forth. When the grader examines the shoes, he is not able to see a previously assigned grade, so as to not influence his own evaluation.</p>
            <h4>3. We package and register your shoes.</h4>
            <p>After each pair has been graded and the necessary numbers and text entered into their respective data fields, all pairs from a particular order are taken from the Grading Department into the Packaging Department. Here, appropriately color-coded tamper-evident holographic labels are printed out bearing the appropriate grade and serial number. This last item is extremely important, as it serves to make each certified pair unique and is also an important deterrent to counterfeiting TSS's valued product. All of the relevant information is tracked in our database.</p>
            <h4>4. We send your shoes along to their next destination.</h4>
            <p>After packaging, all shoes go through a quality control inspection. Here, they are examined to make certain that their labels are correct for both the grade and the serial number. Quality control also inspects each case for any flaws, such as scuffs or nicks. While these are quite rare, TSS is careful to make certain that the shoes we grade are not only accurately graded, but attractively presented as well. No matter whether the US Postal Service or some private carrier is used, the method of packaging is essentially the same.The encapsulated shoes are placed inside boxes made of very sturdy cardboard.</p>

                been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                <p>TSS, THE SNEAKER SAVANT, GOLD SERVICE AND SILVER SERVICE are the registered or unregistered trademarks of TSS  
                in the United States and other countries. This is not 
                a comprehensive list of all TSS trademarks. All other

                <p>Consumers should be aware that the market in sneaker collecting is at times volatile and involves a due measure 
                of risk. Only those who are aware of, and inclined to 
                bear, the financial risk involved with buying and selling 
                sneakers should participate in this market. The opinions 
                expressed in this web page are solely statements of 
                judgment. </p>
                <p>TSS authorized member dealers are independent contractors 
                and individually accountable for the market that they 
                make in TSS graded sneakers. TSS authorized member 
                dealers are also individually accountable for any other 
                contractual undertaking they assume with their clients.</p>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT CONSUMER NOTIFICATION:</strong>
                It is important for consumers to understand that grading 
                and certification by The Sneaker Savant, LLC does not guarantee protection from common risks associated with a market which is potentially volatile. The degree to which sneakers graded and certified by TSS are liquid will vary according to market conditions at a given time for the sneakers involved. For some collectible sneakers there may, at times, be no active market.</p>
                <p><b>Notices regarding TSS’s Census Report</b> </p>
                <p>The utilization of this report as a tool for assessing the population and value of sneakers in any character or grade is unreliable. The following characteristics inherent in the marketplace undermine the accuracy of this report:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Inexpensive sneakers, which are not generally submitted for certification, may appear scarce but are not</li>
                  <li>Sneaker grading services are predominantly utilized for higher-grade sneakers</li>
                  <li>Certified sneakers are often removed from their holders without notifying the grading service; therefore, computer tallies utilized to provide population 
                  reports may be misleading</li>
                  <li>Rarity is only one factor that must be weighed in determining the market value of a pair of sneakers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TSS encourages all collectors to seek the counsel of qualified professionals familiar with the certified sneaker marketplace before making any purchase based on this report.</p></div>
